content__text_1: <p>The unstoppable, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is the most desired e-commerce stock investors are after, and there is a good reason for that. Amazon has made and will continue making, <b>investors like you incredibly wealthy</b>. How wealthy? If you were to invest $10,000 in Amazon back in the days, your wealth would be worth <b>more than $12 million</b>. That’s life-changing wealth.</p>

Amazon is the third-largest publicly traded company on the U.S. exchanges valued $1.34 trillion. Amazon’s stock, which outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark, has seen plenty of upsides in the last 5 years, growing expediently with a <b>468.11% increase</b>, making many investors exceedingly happy.</p>

content__text_3: '<p>If you think you have missed the train, ask yourself - can you imagine a life without Amazon? Now more than ever, due to COVID-19, Amazon has touched nearly every part of life in lockdown — household essentials, groceries, streaming, gaming, crafts, news and entertainment. Even the sites that people visit — Netflix, Pinterest, Facebook — are run on its cloud computing Amazon Web Services.</p>'

content__text_4: <p>Amazon reaped $75.5 billion in sales in the first quarter of 2020 (compared with $59.7 billion during the same time last year). Its physical store sales, including Whole Foods, grew to $4.6 billion; and its cloud computing business crossed the $10 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time, growing 33 percent in one year.</p>

content__text_5: <p>There should be no doubt. Amazon is unstoppable. There is nothing to get in the way of this behemoth company. Amazon will continue to interact with millions of people, globally, each day. Amazon will continue with its overall market share and proving over and over again, outrageous opportunities for investors.</p>
